Hi, I’m Greg!

I am currently looking for work as a data analyst! I am currently residing in the Seattle area.

About me...

I got a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Florida and completed a few internships along the way at General Electric, Disney and Boeing. After graduation, I decided to work for Boeing as a liaison engineer manufacturing commercial airplanes and then switching roles to developing fastening and assembly technologies. I was exposed to a lot of data and spreadsheets in my career. I gained an interest in the analytical side and through taking various courses on Udacity and Coursera, I was exposed to many aspects of data science such as programming, creating visualizations and building machine learning models. I then decided to go back to school full time and got a technical 2 year degree in Artificial Intelligence at Bellevue College and completed the Google Data Analyst program on Cousera. Here are some key skills that I have acquired through the programs.

Programming: Through the programs I was able to build upon my programming skills in SQL, Python and R. 

Visualization: I became proficient in creating visualizations in Tableau and Excel and creating pivot tables in PowerPivot.

Statistics: With my background in engineering, I have taken many courses in math and statistics and have a good understanding of probabilities, distributions, variance and regression. I did recently complete another refresh course in statistics. 

Machine Learning: One of my favorite aspects of data science has been creating and applying various machine learning models such as logistic regression, KNN, SVM, neural networks and K Means. I am familiar with the Scikit-learn python packages.

Computer Vision: I have also taken some courses in computer vision and have a basic understanding of image representation and object detection/recognition concepts using the OpenCV library.

Business Intelligence: In addition, I got my Business Intelligence Analyst Certification. I have a good understanding of relational database design and business analysis.

I will upload some of my past projects here for exposure.
