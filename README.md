Hi, I’m Greg.

I am currently looking for work as an entry level data analyst! 

I got a degree in Mechanical Engineering and worked about 5 years in various roles building refrigerators, supporting Disney's parks and supporting airplane production. I was exposed to lots of data through my work and then took various Data Science courses through Udacity and Coursera. 
I then decided to learn it full time and am working on a few certificates at my local college.

My skills in Data Science include coding in SQL, Python and R. I have familiarity with working with databases in MS SSMS. I am proficient in Tableau for visualization and PowerPivot for creating pivot tables and for visualizations.

For analytics, I have an understanding of statistics such as probablilities, distributions, variance and regression. I have learned and applied various machine learning models using Scikit-learn such as logistic regression, KNN, SVM, neural networks and K Means.

I have also taken some courses in computer vision and understand basic image representation and object detection and recongition concepts.

In addition, I have taken some business intelligence courses in data modeling and business analysis. I have used Visual Studios for working with multi-dimensional databases creating cubes and reports. I have also used the software to create mining models such as decision trees and for clustering.

Will upload my work here for exposure.

Currently residing in the Seattle area.
